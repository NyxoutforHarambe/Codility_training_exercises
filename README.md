# Codility_training_exercises
Python solutions for programming problems available on "https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/"

Hello ! This repo contains solutions to codility training examples which can be accessed by going on the link given above.
This repo will be updated every week until I run out of codility training examples.
The examples are pretty interesting. I urge you to try them first yourself.

Note : If any of the examples are erroneous / you come up with better solutions, raise an issue / send me a pull request. I shall get back ASAP.

Good luck ! Have fun ! :)
